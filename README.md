# Pure External Organization Merging Tool

A tool for merging duplicated External Organizations in Elsevier Pure using the
new write API.

The auto-generated Angular docs below should be enough to get it running, but
note the use of `src/app/proxy.conf.json` to get round CORS issues during
development (haven't deployed this yet...).
